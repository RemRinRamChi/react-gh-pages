components
|- children (will have own styles and components)
!- index.js for exports

child
- Child.jsx - jsx == js actually in functionality but it serves to tell this file contains JSX, not standard JS
- Child.module.css - scopes the css to the child
    - import styles from "./App.module.css";
    - <div className={styles.container}>
